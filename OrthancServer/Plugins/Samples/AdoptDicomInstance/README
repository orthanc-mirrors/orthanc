This sample plugin illustrates how to use the
"OrthancPluginAdoptDicomInstance()" primitive in the Orthanc SDK.

The plugin replaces the built-in storage area of Orthanc, by a flat
directory "./OrthancStorage" containing the attachments.

DICOM instances can then be adopted by typing:

$ curl http://localhost:8042/adopt -d /tmp/sample.dcm

An adopted DICOM instance is not copied inside the "OrthancStorage"
folder, but is read from its original location (in the example above,
from "/tmp/sample.dcm").
