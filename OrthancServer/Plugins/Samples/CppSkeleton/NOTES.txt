=======

This folder contains a sample, minimal C++ plugin for Orthanc that
supports multiple target architectures. This skeleton also illustrates
how to properly include the Orthanc Framework and how to use embedded
resources.


Build instructions
==================

To compile for developers:

$ mkdir Build
$ cd Build
$ cmake .. \
        -DORTHANC_FRAMEWORK_ROOT=${PWD}/../../../../../OrthancFramework/Sources \
        -DORTHANC_FRAMEWORK_SOURCE=path \
        -DUSE_SYSTEM_ORTHANC_SDK=OFF
$ make -j4


Shipping to users
=================

If shipping the plugin to users (i.e., non-developers), you would have
to prepare your project by typing:

$ ./Resources/SyncOrthancFolder.py

The resulting content of the "./Resources/Orthanc/" must be included
in your project.

Evidently, do not forget to adapt the values in "CMakeLists.txt"

The users would then use the following build instructions:

$ mkdir Build
$ cd Build
$ cmake .. -DALLOW_DOWNLOADS=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_ORTHANC_SDK=OFF
$ make -j4
